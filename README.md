# Overview

As a software engineer eager to enhance my skills, I developed a Java program demonstrating file encryption and decryption. The primary goal is to showcase proficiency in Java language syntax and highlight key concepts related to cryptography, file I/O, and user interaction through a simple command-line interface.

The program allows users to encrypt and decrypt the contents of a file using the AES encryption algorithm with CBC mode and PKCS5 padding. The software employs standard Java libraries for cryptographic operations, demonstrating secure file handling techniques.

# Software Demo Video

In the demonstration video, I provide a 4-5 minute walkthrough of the program's functionality. I emphasize key aspects of the Java language syntax utilized in the code. The focus is on understanding how cryptographic operations, file handling, and user interaction are implemented in Java.

# Development Environment

The software was developed using the following tools:

- **IDE:** Visual Studio Code
- **Programming Language:** Java
- **Libraries:** Standard Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA)

# Useful Websites

During the development of this project, the following websites were valuable resources:

- [Oracle Java Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/)
- [Java Programming and Software Engineering Courses on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/java-programming)
- []

# Future Work

In future iterations, I plan to address the following:

- **Improved User Interface:** Enhance the command-line interface for a more user-friendly experience.
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to gracefully manage unexpected situations.
- **Algorithm Flexibility:** Allow users to choose different encryption algorithms and modes.
- **Embed Algorithm Inencryptio** Allow the algorithm to be part of the encrypted file so that the user can run and encrypt a file, and decrypt it after out side of the same run.
